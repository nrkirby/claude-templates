# Common Edge Case Checklist

When analysing a module, consider these common scenarios:

-Connection refused, DNS resolution failure, network unreachable
-Partial responses (connection dropped mid-transfer)
-Idempotency: repeated POST/PUT requests producing duplicates
-CORS preflight failures (browser context)

## For Concurrency and Parallelism

-Race conditions: two operations reading then writing the same resource
-Deadlocks: circular resource acquisition
-Resource contention: multiple consumers, single producer (and vice versa)
-Ordering guarantees: events arriving out of order
-Lost updates: read-modify-write without locking
-Double-checked locking failures
-Thread safety of shared mutable state
-Atomic operation assumptions (non-atomic compound operations)
-Stale reads from caches or replicas
-Thundering herd: many waiters released simultaneously
-Priority inversion: low-priority task holding resource needed by high-priority
-Graceful shutdown: in-flight requests during termination
-Queue overflow: producer faster than consumer
-Callback/promise ordering: assumptions about execution order of async callbacks
-Connection pool exhaustion under load
